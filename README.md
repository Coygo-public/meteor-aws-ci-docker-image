[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Lunafi/meteor-docker-image.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Lunafi/meteor-docker-image)

This image was built in order to create Docker images with meteor and aws cli on a CI job. It also includes java, so you can run e2e tests (i.e. Chimp) after a Meteor docker image is created.
